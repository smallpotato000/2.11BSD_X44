 * microseconds (e.g., seconds and nanoseconds).  Instead:

 *	introduce a new structure for the new format;

 *	send mail to "tcpdump-workers@tcpdump.org", requesting a new
 *	magic number for your new capture file format, and, when
 *	you get the new magic number, put it in "savefile.c";
 *
 *	use that magic number for save files with the changed record
 *	header;
 *
 *	make the code in "savefile.c" capable of reading files with
 *	the old record header as well as files with the new record header
 *	(using the magic number to determine the header format).
 *
 * Then supply the changes to "patches@tcpdump.org", so that future
 * versions of libpcap and programs that use it (such as tcpdump) will
 * be able to read your new capture file format.
